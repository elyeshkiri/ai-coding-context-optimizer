# CLI reference

ACCO now exposes one discoverable top-level command surface:

```bash
acco --help
acco commands
acco <command> --help
```

`acco --help` lists both registry-backed commands and
legacy-compatible commands. `acco commands` lists the registry-backed
surface used for new development. The pages below document **all shipped
commands**, including accepted arguments/options, exit semantics, and structured
output contracts.

For machine-readable fields, see [Machine-readable CLI contracts](JSON_OUTPUTS.md).

## Exit-code conventions

The per-command pages are authoritative. Across the CLI, the dominant
convention is:

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `0` | Command completed and requested gates passed. |
| `1` | A requested quality/readiness/check condition failed, or required evidence was unavailable. |
| `2` | Invalid input/configuration, malformed evidence, unsafe mutation refused, or argparse usage error. |

Some legacy-compatible commands use `1` for ordinary file/runtime errors; their
pages call this out explicitly.

## Structured output

Commands with JSON output link directly to
[Machine-readable CLI contracts](JSON_OUTPUTS.md), which documents stable
top-level fields, nullability/gating behavior, and compatibility rules for
automation.

## Shell completion

```bash
acco completion bash > ~/.local/share/acco-completion.bash
acco completion zsh
acco completion fish
```

Completion intentionally covers top-level commands. Subcommand options remain
discoverable with `acco <command> --help`.
