# Installation

ACCO's default install path is intentionally short:

```bash
uv tool install acco
cd /path/to/project
acco setup
acco start
```

`uv` keeps ACCO isolated from project virtual environments and gives
`acco update` a clean upgrade path.

## One-command bootstrap

Use `uvx` to run ACCO's bootstrap entry once:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
uvx acco bootstrap
```

Bootstrap first creates a persistent isolated ACCO installation with
`uv tool install acco` (or `pipx` when available), then runs the
normal project setup. This avoids creating host integrations that depend on the
temporary `uvx` environment.

## pipx

```bash
pipx install acco
acco setup
```

## pip compatibility path

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade acco
acco setup
```

This remains fully supported, but isolated CLI installers are preferred because
they avoid project-environment and PATH confusion.

## Claude Code marketplace

Claude Code 2.1.229+ can install ACCO's generated plugin directly:

```text
/plugin marketplace add elyeshkiri/ai-coding-context-optimizer
/plugin install acco@acco-tools
```

The plugin contains ACCO hooks, MCP integration, Compaction Guardian support,
the ingress skill, and ACCO Lean.

## Standalone release binaries

Tagged releases publish smoke-tested single-file executables for both major
64-bit architectures:

- `acco-linux-x86_64`
- `acco-linux-arm64`
- `acco-macos-arm64`
- `acco-macos-x86_64`
- `acco-windows-x86_64.exe`
- `acco-windows-arm64.exe`

Each binary has a matching SHA-256 sidecar and GitHub build-provenance
attestation. The six targets are built natively from the immutable release tag
and run `acco --help` plus a provider-free `acco demo` smoke test before
upload. Windows Authenticode and macOS Developer ID/notarization are applied
automatically when the corresponding repository signing credentials are
configured.

Linux/macOS users can use the repository installer after a release containing
standalone assets:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elyeshkiri/ai-coding-context-optimizer/main/scripts/install-standalone.sh | sh
```

This path is optional. Review the script first if your environment does not
permit piped shell installers.

### Windows

Windows x86_64 and ARM64 have native standalone installations that do not
require Python:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elyeshkiri/ai-coding-context-optimizer/main/scripts/install-standalone.ps1 | iex
```

The PowerShell installer:

- detects x86_64 versus ARM64 and downloads the matching Windows asset;
- verifies its SHA-256 sidecar before installation;
- installs it under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ACCO\bin` by default;
- smoke-tests `acco.exe --help`;
- adds the install directory to the user's `PATH` idempotently.

Open a new PowerShell terminal after the first install, then:

```powershell
cd C:\path\to\project
acco setup
acco start
```

PowerShell completion is available with:

```powershell
acco completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

For persistent completion, add the generated script to `$PROFILE`.

Native Windows state is stored under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ACCO` (falling back to
`%APPDATA%\ACCO`). `ACCO_STATE_DIR` still overrides the location.

Linux/macOS installers and the Windows installer all verify the downloaded
SHA-256 checksum before installation.

## Homebrew

Tagged releases publish an `acco.rb` formula generated from the verified
Linux/macOS x86_64 and ARM64 checksums. The release formula works directly:

```bash
brew install --formula \
  https://github.com/elyeshkiri/ai-coding-context-optimizer/releases/latest/download/acco.rb
```

The repository also contains a secret-gated publisher that can create/update
`elyeshkiri/homebrew-acco`. Once that external tap has actually been
published, the normal flow is:

```bash
brew tap elyeshkiri/acco
brew install acco
```

## WinGet

Each release also includes `winget-manifests.zip` containing schema 1.12
multi-file manifests for x64 and ARM64 portable executables. ACCO includes an
optional publisher workflow that can submit those manifests with
`wingetcreate` when `WINGET_TOKEN` is configured. Microsoft still controls
acceptance into the public WinGet community repository; only after that
upstream PR is accepted should users expect:

```powershell
winget install --id ElyesHkiri.ACCO
```

See [Native release signing and package publication](RELEASE_SIGNING.md).

## Upgrade and repair

Inspect the package-manager command ACCO would use:

```bash
acco update
```

Apply it explicitly:

```bash
acco update --apply
acco setup
```

For raw standalone installs on Linux, macOS, or Windows,
`acco update --apply` detects the current OS/architecture, downloads the
matching release asset and SHA-256 sidecar, verifies integrity, and smoke-tests
the replacement. Linux/macOS replace atomically; Windows schedules replacement
after the current `acco.exe` exits.

When the frozen executable belongs to Homebrew or WinGet, ACCO deliberately
delegates the upgrade back to that package manager instead of overwriting
managed files.

`setup` is idempotent and doubles as the integration repair/migration command.
It also refreshes the structural index and verifies readiness.

## Remove

```bash
acco uninstall . --host all
acco uninstall . --host all --remove-config
```

Only ACCO-owned integration entries are removed.
